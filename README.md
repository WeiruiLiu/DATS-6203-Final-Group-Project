## Age, Gender, and Ethnicity Prediction and Classification - CNN
### Introduction
---
In recent years, the extraction of age, gender, and ethnicity from facial images has
been widely used in many applications, including biometrics, security controls, and
entertainment. Convolutional Neural Network has achieved remarkable success in
face recognition, image classification, and object recognition. This final project uses
the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on face recognition tasks for age estimation
and ethnicity and gender classification.
